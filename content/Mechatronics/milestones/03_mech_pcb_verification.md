# Phase 3 — Mechanical Design, PCB, Verification

## Outcome

Professional-grade physical and electrical design. From "works on the breadboard" to "manufacturable, reliable, documented."

This phase is where the mechanical gaps become concrete. Every joint is a bearing + shaft + fastener + seal problem. Every bracket is a manufacturing process question. Every PCB is an EMC and power integrity problem. The CAD is not the engineering — the engineering is knowing what the CAD is telling the machine shop to do, and what the PCB layout is telling the electromagnetic field to do.

## Pre-Design Requirements

Fill `templates/requirements_brief.md` before opening CAD or KiCad.

### Motor + Transmission Sizing (required before CAD)

For each axis, document:

- [ ] **Load torque:** gravity (worst-case pose), friction (bearing + seal), payload. Sum = continuous torque requirement.
- [ ] **Acceleration torque:** τ_acc = J_total × α. J_total = J_motor + J_load_reflected. For a gear/belt/lead screw with ratio N: J_load_reflected = J_load / N². This is why high reduction ratios make the load "look lighter" to the motor.
- [ ] **Torque-speed check:** plot the motor's torque-speed curve. Mark the operating point (continuous torque at max speed). Verify it's inside the curve, with margin. If not: bigger motor, higher supply voltage, or higher reduction ratio.
- [ ] **Inertia ratio:** J_load_reflected / J_motor. Target < 10:1 for responsive control. > 10:1 → the load dominates, the controller fights the mechanics, tuning is painful. If ratio is too high: increase reduction ratio (reduces reflected inertia by N²).
- [ ] **Transmission selection:**
  - Timing belt (GT2): low backlash (~0.1–0.3mm), moderate precision, good for long travel, low cost. Ratio = driven_teeth / driver_teeth.
  - Lead screw (T8, TR8): high force, self-locking (Acme), lower speed, backlash in nut. For Z-axes and linear stages.
  - Ball screw: high efficiency (~90%), backdrivable, precise, expensive. For CNC and high-performance axes.
  - Direct drive: no transmission. Zero backlash. Requires high-torque motor. For joints where precision matters more than speed.
- [ ] **Belt drive details:** tooth engagement, belt tension, pulley inertia, bearing load from tension, and expected backlash/compliance documented.
- [ ] **Lead screw details:** efficiency, self-locking/backdrivability, critical speed, column buckling, nut backlash, and anti-backlash or brake requirement documented.
- [ ] **Motor + transmission pairing documented:** "Axis 1: NEMA17 + GT2 20T→60T (3:1), reflected inertia = X, acceleration torque = Y, continuous torque = Z. Operating point is inside the torque-speed curve with 30% margin."

### System Power Budget (required before schematic)

Before opening KiCad, document:

- [ ] **Every rail:** list all voltage rails needed (e.g., 3.3V logic, 5V sensors, 12V gate drive, 24–48V motor bus).
- [ ] **Every load on each rail:** MCU (active/sleep), sensors, gate drivers, fans, LEDs, encoder, communication transceivers. Current per load per mode.
- [ ] **Every operating mode:** idle (MCU running, motors off), active (motors running nominal), peak (motors stalled, all peripherals on). Sum per rail per mode.
- [ ] **Regulator sizing:** for each rail, choose topology (LDO vs. buck) and size with 30% margin above peak load. Document why: "3.3V rail: peak load 450 mA, LDO at 5V input dissipates 0.77W — acceptable. Buck not needed." Or: "12V→3.3V at 1A: LDO dissipates 8.7W — buck converter required."
- [ ] **Fuse / protection sizing:** input fuse rated for peak current + inrush. Document: "Input fuse: 5A slow-blow. Peak motor current 4A × 2 axes = 8A. Inrush 12A for 10ms. Slow-blow survives inrush, clears sustained overcurrent."
- [ ] **Battery / supply sizing:** if battery-powered: capacity (Ah) × voltage = energy (Wh). Divide by average power = runtime. If bench-powered: supply must deliver peak current without current-limiting.

This is not optional. If you skip the power budget, you'll discover at power-on that the 3.3V rail sags under load, or the fuse blows on startup, or the regulator overheats. The budget takes 1 hour. Redesigning the power stage after layout takes 2 weeks.

# Milestone 3.1 — CAD + Machine Elements + FEA + Drawings

## Deliverable

Complete 2-DOF arm in Solid Edge Community Edition (free, no student ID): parametric parts, selected bearings with fits, sized shafts, specified fasteners, motor mounts, verified by hand calcs and FEA in PrePoMax (free, open-source, CalculiX solver), with manufacturing drawings and a DFM review.

**Tool pipeline:** Solid Edge CE (Windows) → export `.STEP` → PrePoMax (Windows, portable, no install) → static stress / modal / buckling. On macOS: FreeCAD opens STEP natively for quick viewing, measurement, and light edits without booting Windows.

This is not just "draw the arm." This is "design the joints so they actually rotate smoothly under load, survive fatigue, and can be manufactured."

## Pass Condition

### MVM
- [ ] Assembly modeled, interference-free
- [ ] At least one Poka-yoke feature
- [ ] Hand calc: worst-case bending stress, FoS documented
- [ ] FEA: static stress run, max stress location identified
- [ ] Bearing selected for each joint: type (deep groove ball, angular contact, etc.), size from load rating, documented

### Full Pass
- [ ] All parts fully parametric
- [ ] Real bearings and motor mounts from datasheets
- [ ] **Bearing fits:** shaft tolerance (e.g., k6 for inner ring rotating load), housing tolerance (e.g., H7 for outer ring stationary). Can explain WHY: interference fit on the rotating ring prevents creep; clearance fit on the stationary ring allows thermal expansion.
- [ ] **Bearing life:** L10 life calculated for expected load and speed. Can explain: L10 = (C/P)^p × 10⁶ revolutions. C = dynamic load rating, P = equivalent load, p = 3 for ball bearings.
- [ ] **Shaft design:** diameter from torsional and bending stress. Keyway or clamp-style coupling. Retaining rings or shoulders for axial location. Critical speed estimated (even roughly): if the arm never spins fast, document why it's not a concern.
- [ ] **Fastener design:** bolt grade (8.8, 10.9, 12.9), preload target, torque spec. Can explain: preload creates clamping force. The joint stiffness determines how much additional load the bolt sees. Loose joint → bolt sees full cyclic load → fatigue. Tight joint → bolt sees a fraction.
- [ ] **Springs / counterbalance:** if the arm is gravity-loaded, document the holding torque. Is a counterbalance spring needed? If yes: spring rate, preload, geometry. If no: document why the motors can hold static load continuously without overheating.
- [ ] Hand calcs: bending, shear, torsion on critical link
- [ ] FEA validated vs. hand calcs, within 20%, explain discrepancy
- [ ] Mesh convergence checked: run 3 mesh densities in PrePoMax, plot max stress vs. element count, confirm < 5% change between finest two
- [ ] PrePoMax workflow documented: STEP import → material assignment → mesh (tetra dominant) → boundary conditions → solve → probe max stress → compare to hand calc. Screenshots in `docs/captures/`
- [ ] FreeCAD verified as macOS STEP viewer: opened the arm assembly, measured a critical dimension, confirmed it matches Solid Edge
- [ ] GD&T drawings: flatness, concentricity, pin fits
- [ ] Tolerance stack-up: worst-case AND RSS
- [ ] **DFM review:** check every part against the 5 rules from Milestone 0.8. Document: can this be made on a 3-axis mill? Are there internal sharp corners? Are tolerances tighter than necessary? Is the material appropriate for the process?
- [ ] Transmission integration checked: belt tensioner/idler, lead screw support/coupling, anti-backlash, bearing retention, and motor/shaft alignment documented
- [ ] Robust design reviewed: performance sensitivity to tolerance stack, wear, assembly variation, and thermal expansion; critical tolerances justified, non-critical tolerances loosened.
- [ ] Drawings sent for fabrication

## ⚠️ Landmines

1. **CAD without constraints is sculpture.** `[HYPOTHESIS]`
   Fully constrained sketches. Proper mates. Change one dimension → assembly updates, doesn't explode.

2. **FEA without hand calcs is a pretty picture.** `[COMMUNITY]`
   Estimate max stress by hand, σ = Mc/I, τ = Tr/J, BEFORE running FEA. FEA always gives a number. The question is whether it's right.

3. **Boundary conditions are where FEA goes wrong.** `[COMMUNITY]`
   Max stress at a constraint point → BCs are wrong. Point loads → infinite stress. Fix the model, not the mesh.

4. **Tolerance stack-up kills assemblies.** `[HYPOTHESIS]`
   ±0.1mm per joint × 5 joints = ±0.5mm at tip. Calculate BEFORE ordering.

5. **3D printing ≠ CNC design rules.** `[HYPOTHESIS]`
   Layer adhesion direction matters. Orient prints so layers are perpendicular to primary load.

6. **Bearing fit is not "snug."** `[COMMUNITY]`
   A bearing on a shaft with too-loose a fit will spin on the shaft (fretting corrosion, destroys both surfaces). Too tight and you can't assemble it, or you preload the bearing radially and reduce its life. The fit is specified by ISO tolerance classes for a reason. Look up the bearing manufacturer's recommendation (SKF, NSK, Timken all publish fit tables).

7. **Bearing life is load-dependent, not time-dependent.** `[COMMUNITY]`
   L10 life scales with (C/P)³. Double the load → ⅛ the life. If your arm is heavier than expected, or the payload is higher, bearing life drops dramatically. Calculate with worst-case load, not nominal.

8. **Fastener preload is the design variable, not torque.** `[COMMUNITY]`
   Torque is how you ACHIEVE preload. But friction (thread + under-head) consumes 85–90% of applied torque. The same torque on a lubricated vs. dry bolt gives wildly different preload. For critical joints: specify preload, use torque + friction coefficient, or use a torque-angle method.

9. **A bearing without a retention method will walk.** `[HYPOTHESIS]`
   Axial loads, vibration, and thermal cycling cause bearings to migrate. Shoulders, retaining rings, end caps, or threaded locknuts. Every bearing needs an axial location method on both inner and outer rings.

10. **DFM review is not optional polish.** `[HYPOTHESIS]`
The 5 rules from Milestone 0.8 exist for this moment. Check them. If a part has an internal sharp corner, the machine shop will email you. If a tolerance is ±0.01mm where ±0.1mm works, you're paying 5× for no reason. 30 minutes of DFM review saves weeks of fab back-and-forth.
11. **Solid Edge Community Edition exports STEP freely, but cannot open other people's native `.par`/`.asm` files.** `[COMMUNITY]`
This means: your workflow is always Solid Edge → STEP → everything else. If a supplier sends you a native Solid Edge file, you can't open it on CE. Ask for STEP or IGES. This is the only real limitation. Plan your file exchanges accordingly.
12. **PrePoMax is Windows-only and portable (no installer), but it is not a toy.** `[COMMUNITY]`
It wraps CalculiX, the same solver used in academic and industrial FEA. The GUI is clean and modern. But: it has no native macOS build. Run it via Parallels, Boot Camp, or a Windows VM on your Mac. The portable `.zip` means you can run it from a USB stick. Latest version: v2.5.2. Forum: prepomax.discourse.group. Jakub Michalski's YouTube series (50+ tutorials) is the best learning resource.
13. **PrePoMax boundary conditions are where your FEA goes wrong, not the mesh.** `[HYPOTHESIS]`
Same principle as landmine 3, but specific to the tool: PrePoMax lets you apply point loads and fixed constraints easily. A point load on a sharp corner gives infinite stress. A fixed constraint on a single face over-constrains the model. Distribute loads over areas. Constrain only what's physically restrained. The pretty colour contour is meaningless if the BCs are wrong.
14. **FreeCAD on macOS is a STEP viewer, not your primary CAD tool.** `[HYPOTHESIS]`
FreeCAD's FEM workbench also wraps CalculiX and can import STEP files. But its GUI is less polished than PrePoMax's, and the learning curve is steeper. Use FreeCAD for: opening STEP files on macOS, quick measurements, light geometry edits. Use PrePoMax for: actual FEA. Use Solid Edge for: actual design. Don't try to do everything in one tool.

## Dependencies that waste your week if hit backwards

- Define constraints on paper, work envelope, payload, motor selections, material, manufacturing method, BEFORE opening CAD.
- **Complete the motor + transmission sizing (Pre-Design section above) BEFORE opening CAD.** The motor dimensions, shaft size, and transmission geometry constrain the entire joint design. If you design the housing first and then discover the motor doesn't fit, you redesign everything.
- Hand calcs BEFORE FEA. You need the hand calc to validate the FEA.
- Verify motor mounting dimensions against the actual motor datasheet BEFORE finalizing the joint housing.
- Select bearings BEFORE designing the housing bore and shaft diameter. The bearing is a purchased component with fixed dimensions. The shaft and housing are designed AROUND the bearing, not the other way around.
- Do the DFM review BEFORE sending drawings to fab. Not after. Not "I'll fix it when they ask questions."
- **Install and verify the Solid Edge → STEP → PrePoMax pipeline BEFORE starting the arm design.** Model a simple L-bracket in Solid Edge, export STEP, open in PrePoMax, run a static analysis, compare to hand calc. If the pipeline doesn't work, you discover it on a 30-minute bracket, not on the 5-week arm assembly.
- **Verify FreeCAD opens your STEP files on macOS BEFORE you need it in a hurry.** Export a test part from Solid Edge, open in FreeCAD, measure a dimension. If it works, you have a macOS fallback. If it doesn't, you know now.

# Milestone 3.2 — First Custom PCB + Power Stage + EMC

## Deliverable

Custom STM32 motor driver shield: designed in KiCad, power stage designed (not copied), EMC design rules applied, manufactured, assembled, powered up with verified rails.

## BOM Sanity

Before finalizing schematic:
- [ ] Every IC has manufacturer part number.
- [ ] Every IC has orderable distributor SKU.
- [ ] Every critical part has at least one substitute.
- [ ] Package matches footprint.
- [ ] Voltage/current/thermal ratings checked.
- [ ] Stock exists today or lead time is acceptable.

## Power Stage Design (required before layout)

- [ ] **Logic rail:** 3.3V for MCU, sensors, logic. If total logic current < 300mA and input is 5V: LDO is fine (simple, low noise). If > 300mA or input is 12–48V: buck converter (efficient, but noisier). Document the decision and why.
- [ ] **Gate driver supply:** typically 10–15V for MOSFET gate drive. If the main supply is 12V, a simple LDO or resistor-zener may suffice. If 24–48V, a buck converter or isolated supply is needed.
- [ ] **Bootstrap capacitor:** for high-side gate drive in half-bridge configurations. C_boot ≥ Q_g × V_gs / ΔV. Q_g = total gate charge from MOSFET datasheet. ΔV = allowable droop (typically 0.5–1V). If C_boot is too small, the high-side gate voltage sags during long on-times → MOSFET enters linear region → overheats → dies.
- [ ] **Inrush current:** large capacitors on the power rail look like a short at power-on. Add an NTC thermistor, a series resistor + relay bypass, or a soft-start circuit. Without it: the supply current-limits, the voltage sags, the MCU brown-outs, and you spend a day debugging "random" resets.
- [ ] **Reverse polarity protection:** series diode (simple, 0.3–0.7V drop), P-MOSFET (low drop, more complex), or ideal diode controller. If someone plugs the supply in backwards, the board should not smoke.
- [ ] **Test points:** critical rails, current-sense outputs, PWM/gate signals, and communication lines have probe points or headers for bring-up and debug.
- [ ] **Power sequencing:** logic rail must be stable before the MCU starts. Gate driver supply must be stable before PWM outputs enable. If the MCU starts before the gate driver is ready, the PWM pins may float → MOSFETs partially on → shoot-through. Use enable pins, power-good signals, or RC delays.
- [ ] **Can explain:** why a buck converter instead of an LDO at high current (P_loss = (V_in - V_out) × I. At 12V→3.3V, 1A: LDO dissipates 8.7W. Buck dissipates ~0.5W). Why bootstrap needs refresh (the cap charges when the low-side FET is on; if the high-side stays on too long, the cap drains). Why inrush matters (capacitor impedance at t=0 is ~0).

## EMC Design (required before and during layout)

This is not a polish step. This is not "add shielding at the end." EMC is a layout discipline. Get it wrong and the board radiates, the encoder glitches, the ADC reads noise, and you can't tell if the problem is firmware or hardware. 

- [ ] **Ground plane strategy:** solid, unbroken ground plane on at least one inner layer (4-layer board) or the bottom layer (2-layer board). No splits. No moats. No "analog ground" and "digital ground" separated by a gap. One plane. Separate analog and digital circuits by PLACEMENT (analog near the connector, digital near the MCU), not by plane splits. Can explain: a split plane forces return currents to detour around the split. Loop area increases. Radiation increases. The detour path also has higher inductance → more noise coupling. 
- [ ] **Switching node management:** the LX/SW node on a buck converter or gate driver switches between 0V and VIN at MHz frequencies with nanosecond edges. This is a broadband RF source. Keep the switching node trace SHORT (< 5mm), NARROW, and on an inner layer if possible. Do NOT route sensitive signals (encoder, ADC, SPI) near it. Do NOT place the inductor directly over a ground plane gap. Can explain: the switching node has high dV/dt (volts per nanosecond). Any copper near it couples capacitively. The inductor has high dI/dt and radiates magnetically. Both are noise sources. 
- [ ] **Input capacitor placement:** the input capacitor to a buck converter must be < 5mm from the VIN and GND pins. The loop formed by (VIN pin → cap → GND pin → back to VIN) carries the full switching current at MHz frequencies. If this loop is large, it radiates. Place the cap first. Route everything else around it. 
- [ ] **Signal routing:** encoder signals, SPI, I2C, UART — route away from motor traces and switching nodes. If they must cross, cross at 90° (minimizes parallel run length). Motor power traces: wide, short, on outer layers if possible, with ground plane underneath for shielding. Can explain: parallel runs create capacitive and inductive coupling. 90° crossings minimize the coupling area.
- [ ] **Cables and connectors:** motor cables shielded/twisted, signal cables separated, shield grounding strategy defined, and connector strain relief considered.
- [ ] **Decoupling:** 100 nF ceramic on every MCU power pin, < 3mm from the pin. 10 µF bulk per rail, near the regulator output. Can explain: the 100 nF handles high-frequency transients (ns timescale). The 10 µF handles medium-frequency (µs). The regulator handles low-frequency (ms). Each has a different impedance-vs-frequency curve. You need all three.
- [ ] **Can explain why PWM creates EMI:** the motor phase voltage switches between 0V and Vbus at 10–20 kHz with ~50 ns edges. The Fourier transform of a 50 ns edge has significant energy up to ~1/(π × 50ns) ≈ 6 MHz. The motor cables act as antennas. The switching loop (FET → motor → shunt → back) has high dI/dt. Both radiate. The fix: slow the edges (gate resistor), shorten the loops, shield the cables, filter the outputs.

- [ ] All rails within ±10%
- [ ] Motor driver switches a load on command

### Full Pass
- [ ] ERC + DRC clean
- [ ] Gerbers accepted by fab

- [ ] Power-stage reliability checked: MOSFET SOA, component derating, transient thermal impedance, regulator stability/compensation, and connector/wire lifecycle considered.

## ⚠️ Landmines

1. **Footprint mismatch kills the board.** `[COMMUNITY]`
   For every non-trivial IC: open datasheet → "Recommended PCB Land Pattern." Cross-reference pad count, pin 1, courtyard. SOT-23-5 vs SOT-23-6, SOIC-8 vs SOIC-8-EP, flipped pin 1. 5 min per IC. Missing it costs a 3-week fab cycle. **#1 because it ends the milestone.**

2. **Draw ground return paths as arrows BEFORE layout.** `[COMMUNITY]`
   Motor return, ADC return, MCU return. If two arrows share a trace segment before the star point, that's noise injection.

3. **Trace width for stall current, not nominal.** `[COMMUNITY — IPC-2221]`
   Stall is 3–5× running. Size for stall.

4. **Decoupling: < 3 mm means < 3 mm.** `[COMMUNITY]`
   100 nF ceramic 2 cm away is decoration. Place decoupling first, then route.

5. **Fab wait IS the deload.** `[HYPOTHESIS]`
   1–3 weeks. Don't start new theory. Documentation, cold-toolchain touches, synthesis.

6. **Stencil for QFP/LQFP.** `[HYPOTHESIS]`
   Hand-soldering 48-pin LQFP is painful. Order the stencil. Paste + hotplate or reflow. If hand-soldering: flux is not optional.

7. **Bootstrap capacitor is not "just a cap."** `[COMMUNITY]`
   Too small → high-side gate sags → MOSFET linear region → thermal destruction. Too large → slow charge → startup delay. The value comes from Q_g and allowable droop. Calculate it. Don't copy 1µF from a reference design without checking.

8. **Buck converter layout is not forgiving.** `[COMMUNITY]`
   The input capacitor must be < 5mm from the VIN and GND pins. The switch node (LX) trace must be short and narrow (it's a high dV/dt antenna). The feedback resistor divider must route away from the inductor and switch node. Get the layout wrong → oscillation, EMI, or regulator instability. Follow the datasheet layout example exactly. 

9. **Power sequencing is not "it'll probably be fine."** `[HYPOTHESIS]`
   If the MCU starts before the gate driver supply is stable, the PWM outputs may be in an undefined state. On some MCUs, GPIO pins float at reset. Floating PWM → MOSFETs partially on → shoot-through → dead board. Use the gate driver's enable pin, held low until the logic rail is good.

10. **Ground plane splits are the #1 EMC mistake.** `[COMMUNITY]`
    If you split the ground plane (analog ground / digital ground / power ground) and route a signal across the split, the return current has to detour around the split. Loop area increases. EMI increases. The fix: one solid ground plane. Separate analog and digital by PLACEMENT, not by plane splits. Star grounding is for the power distribution topology, not for splitting the ground plane. 

11. **The switching node is an antenna.** `[COMMUNITY]`
    The LX pin on a buck converter switches between 0V and VIN at MHz frequencies with nanosecond edges. This is a broadband RF source. Keep the LX trace short (< 5mm), narrow, and away from sensitive signals. A copper pour under it (on the same layer, connected to ground) acts as a shield. Do NOT clear the ground plane under the switching node — the ground plane IS the shield. 

12. **Power budget is not "add up the currents."** `[HYPOTHESIS]`
    Include inrush (capacitors charging), startup (all rails ramping simultaneously), and worst-case operating (all motors stalled, all LEDs on, MCU at max clock). The fuse and supply must survive the worst case, not the nominal case. If you budget for nominal and test at peak, the fuse blows and you think the board is broken.

## Dependencies that waste your week if hit backwards

- Verify ALL IC footprints against datasheet land patterns BEFORE opening KiCad. This is Step 0, not Step 2.
- Draw the ground return path diagram BEFORE layout. Star ground is a routing constraint, not an afterthought.
- Know your current-sensing topology, from FOC milestone, BEFORE choosing the ADC/sense resistor topology on the schematic.
- **Design the power stage on paper BEFORE opening KiCad.** Regulator topology, component values, bootstrap cap, inrush method. The schematic is just drawing what you already decided. If you design the power stage inside KiCad, you'll route it wrong and redo the layout.
- **Complete the system power budget BEFORE choosing regulators.** You can't choose a regulator without knowing the load. You can't size a fuse without knowing the peak. The budget is the input to the schematic, not an afterthought.
- **Apply EMC rules DURING layout, not after.** You can't "add EMC" to a finished layout. The ground plane, component placement, and trace routing ARE the EMC design. If you route first and "check EMC" later, you'll redo the layout.
- Order the stencil at the same time as the PCB. Don't wait.
