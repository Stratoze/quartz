# Milestone 4.1 — CAN + C++ Messaging

## Deliverable

Object-oriented C++ communication layer, error-free packets across physical CAN. No dynamic allocation. Compile-time types.

## Pass Condition

### MVM
- [ ] CAN frame sent and received
- [ ] Struct-based packet round-trips correctly
- [ ] No malloc/new in the codebase

### Full Pass
- [ ] Abstract CANObject base class
- [ ] 2+ concrete message types
- [ ] Bus-off recovery, overrun detection
- [ ] CAN physical layer verified: termination, common ground, differential waveform, and bit timing/sample point documented
- [ ] Message design documented: IDs, structs, endianness, versioning, timeout/heartbeat behavior

- [ ] 1000-packet stress test: zero dropped
- [ ] Compiles `-Wall -Wextra`, zero warnings

## ⚠️ Landmines

1. **CAN is not UART with extra steps.** `[COMMUNITY]`
   Multi-master broadcast bus with arbitration. You broadcast a frame with an ID; every node decides whether to process it.

2. **Termination resistors are not optional.** `[COMMUNITY]`
   120 Ω at each end. Without them, reflections corrupt frames at higher bit rates. Works at 125k but fails at 500k → check termination.

3. **No dynamic allocation, no exceptions, no RTTI.** `[COMMUNITY]`
   malloc fragments over hours. Exceptions add unpredictable timing. Fixed-size buffers, static allocation, compile-time polymorphism.

4. **CAN bit timing must match on all nodes.** `[COMMUNITY]`
   Sample point, propagation segment, phase segments — identical on every node. Use a bit timing calculator.

5. **Message design is part of reliability.** `[HYPOTHESIS]`
Define IDs, struct layout, endianness, version, timeout, and heartbeat behavior before scaling to multiple nodes. Ambiguous messages become intermittent faults that are painful to diagnose.


## Dependencies that waste your week if hit backwards

- Wire transceivers + termination BEFORE writing any CAN code. Verify the physical layer with a scope first.
- Get a basic frame round-tripping BEFORE designing the packet structure or class hierarchy.

# Milestone 4.2 — Motion Integration + Dynamics-Aware Control

## Deliverable

Inverse kinematics on STM32: X, Y → θ1, θ2, smooth joint-interpolated moves between waypoints. Then: add dynamics-aware feedforward from the Milestone 2.5 model, so the arm moves well under its own coupled inertia, not just "joints go to angles."

## Pass Condition

### MVM
- [ ] IK function: given X, Y, returns θ1, θ2
- [ ] Arm moves to a commanded position
- [ ] Can verify: command X, Y, measure tip, compare

### Full Pass
- [ ] Multi-waypoint trajectory, smooth, no jerky stops
- [ ] Workspace limits enforced
- [ ] Repeatable: same point 10×, tip varies < 1 mm
- [ ] Demo: arm traces a straight line or circle
- [ ] **Feedforward torque:** τ_ff = M(q)q̈_des + C(q, q̇)q̇ + g(q) computed in firmware or precomputed per trajectory point. PID handles the residual. Show: tracking error with feedforward < tracking error without.
- [ ] **Trajectory shaping:** minimum-jerk or trapezoidal velocity profile. No infinite acceleration at waypoints. Can explain: a step command in position → infinite acceleration → infinite torque → actuator saturates → tracking error. Shaped trajectory avoids this.
- [ ] **Coupled motion test:** command a fast diagonal move. Without feedforward, joint 1 sags because joint 2's acceleration changes the inertia seen by joint 1. With feedforward, the sag is reduced. Document the difference.
- [ ] Can explain: this is why Milestone 2.5 existed. The dynamics model is not academic. It's in the control loop.

## ⚠️ Landmines

1. **IK has two solutions, elbow up / down.** `[COMMUNITY]`
   Pick one convention. If the arm flips mid-trajectory, it swings wildly.

2. **Joint limits are physical, not just software.** `[HYPOTHESIS]`
   IK returns θ1 = 200° but the joint stops at 180°. Enforce in software BEFORE commanding motors. Also enforce velocity limits.

3. **Straight-line in workspace ≠ straight-line in joint space.** `[COMMUNITY]`
   Linearly interpolating θ1, θ2 → curved tip path. For straight tip, interpolate in X, Y and compute IK each timestep.

4. **Singularity at full extension.** `[COMMUNITY]`
   θ2 = 0 → Jacobian singular. Small X, Y changes → huge θ changes. Add a margin from the workspace boundary.

5. **Feedforward model mismatch is normal.** `[HYPOTHESIS]`
   Your M(q), C(q, q̇), g(q) model has parameter errors: link mass, CoM location, friction. The feedforward won't be perfect. That's why PID is still there — it handles the residual. If feedforward makes things WORSE, the model is wrong. Check signs, check parameters, check that q̇ and q̈ are in the right frame.

6. **Minimum-jerk is not optional for smooth motion.** `[COMMUNITY]`
   A trapezoidal velocity profile has discontinuous acceleration (jerk = ∞ at transitions). The arm jerks. Minimum-jerk (quintic polynomial) or S-curve profiles make acceleration continuous. The difference is visible and audible.

7. **Don't run the full dynamics model at 1 kHz if it's too slow.** `[HYPOTHESIS]`
   M(q) is 2×2, C is 2×2, g is 2×1. On an STM32F4, this is fast. But if you add friction models, payload estimation, or higher DOF, compute budget matters. Profile it. If the model takes 200 µs and your loop is 1 ms, you have 80% headroom. If it takes 800 µs, you have a problem.

## Dependencies that waste your week if hit backwards

- Derive IK on paper and verify against FK BEFORE coding. FK(θ1, θ2) should return the original X, Y.
- Single-point moves BEFORE multi-waypoint trajectories.
- Verify repeatability at one point BEFORE tracing paths.
- Get PID-only motion working BEFORE adding feedforward. You need the baseline to measure improvement.
- Verify the dynamics model (Milestone 2.5 sim) against real arm behavior BEFORE putting it in firmware. If the sim doesn't match the real arm, the feedforward will fight the PID.

# Milestone 4.3 — Safety + HIL

## Deliverable

Hard-wired dual-channel E-Stop, software-independent, plus automated HIL test bench for fault injection.

## Pass Condition

### MVM
- [ ] E-Stop physically disconnects motor DC bus
- [ ] Pressing E-Stop during motion stops motors immediately
- [ ] HIL: one fault injected, firmware enters safe state

### Full Pass
- [ ] E-Stop: dual-channel, electromechanical contactors
- [ ] Works even if MCU is dead, pull MCU power, press E-Stop, motors stop
- [ ] Safe state defined per axis: de-energize, brake, counterbalance, or controlled stop; gravity axes cannot fall dangerously
- [ ] Enable lines, watchdog/heartbeat, brownout, and fault latch behavior documented and tested
- [ ] Hazard analysis performed: single-point failures, fail-safe vs fail-operational behavior, independent safety paths, and acceptance test criteria defined before integration.
- [ ] HIL: 3+ fault types, overcurrent, encoder dropout, undervoltage
- [ ] Fault log recorded
- [ ] Recovery procedure documented

## ⚠️ Landmines

1. **Software E-Stop is not a safety E-Stop.** `[COMMUNITY — IEC 62061]`
   If it goes through the MCU, a firmware crash means no E-Stop. The safety loop must be HARDWIRED: button → contactor → drops bus power.

2. **Dual-channel means two independent paths.** `[COMMUNITY]`
   One contact can weld shut. Two in series, forced-guided contacts.

3. **HIL must not damage real hardware.** `[HYPOTHESIS]`
   Simulate sensor signals with a secondary MCU. Don't create real overcurrent on the bus. Test the FIRMWARE's response, not hardware survival.

4. **Define the safe state BEFORE building the safety system.** `[HYPOTHESIS]`
   "Stop" is not specific. For an arm under gravity, de-energize = arm falls. Is that safe? Maybe you need a brake or counterbalance.

5. **Enable lines and watchdogs are control safety, not power safety.** `[HYPOTHESIS]`
Firmware enable/disable and watchdog resets can stop a running controller, but they do not guarantee removal of stored energy or motor power. For a true safe state, define the power path, brakes, counterbalances, and contactor behavior independently of software.


## Dependencies that waste your week if hit backwards

- Define the safe state on paper BEFORE wiring anything.
- Test the E-Stop with MCU power PULLED before testing with firmware. The hardware path must work independently.
- Build HIL fault injection on a secondary MCU BEFORE connecting it to the production system.

Predicted failure mode, and why:

# Milestone 4.4 — Workcell Polish

## Deliverable

Clean, labeled, shielded, industry-grade installation. Everything wired, aligned, tested, documented.

## Pass Condition

### MVM
- [ ] All cables routed, labeled, secured
- [ ] No loose wires or dangling connectors
- [ ] EMI shielding on critical signal lines

### Full Pass
- [ ] Braided shielding on motor cables near signal lines
- [ ] Structural mounting verified, no wobble under load
- [ ] Limit switches installed and tested
- [ ] Cold-boot-to-shutdown repeatable 3×
- [ ] Everything labeled: cables, connectors, boards, rails
- [ ] Harness discipline: strain relief, bend radius, connector locking, service access, and both-end labels verified
- [ ] Human factors reviewed: system state/mode visible at a glance, errors are understandable, warnings are prioritized, controls afford correct use, labels/cable IDs support a tired operator, and a naive user can identify stop/recovery.
- [ ] Photos taken, portfolio

## ⚠️ Landmines

1. **EMI is the reason your encoder glitches.** `[COMMUNITY]`
   Motor PWM → broadband noise. Route signal lines perpendicular to power lines. Braided shield on motor cables, grounded at ONE end.

2. **Labels are not optional documentation.** `[HYPOTHESIS]`
   In 3 months you won't remember which connector is which. Label both ends of every cable. Every board. Every rail.

3. **"Polish" is not "add features."** `[HYPOTHESIS]`
   Do not add a conveyor. Do not add a camera. Tighten what's there. Label it. Shield it. Test it cold. Document it. Done.

## Dependencies that waste your week if hit backwards

- Make a wiring diagram BEFORE re-routing cables. Otherwise you'll disconnect something and forget where it went.
- Test limit switches with software limits DISABLED to verify the hardware path independently.
